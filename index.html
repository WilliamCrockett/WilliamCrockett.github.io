                    <p>
                        I am based in Cape Town, South Africa. I have a passion for
                        technology, solving problems and analysing data. When I'm not working,
                        you can find me sailing, coaching sailing, watching sport,
                        or attempting to perfect the art of 'braai-ing' steak.</p><br>

                        <p>
                        I love how technology has changed the world. I think technology can
                        be integrated into just about everything we do. I love solving problems I encounter through
                        code or the manipulation of technology. I have translated this from my work life into
                        my passion, the sport of sailing. I compete competitvely on an array of different boats, and
                        can most commonly be found in the role of navigator, with a tablet in my hand. I love working with
                        our passionate Olympic and Youth national teams, and spend my spare time assisting in vairous
                        roles, especially with integrating technology into the coaching techniques.

                <h4>IT Manager</h4>
                <p>
                    I transitioned to the roll of IT Manager after the vacancy within the company opened up.
                    Due to my intimate knowledge of the business and it's products, coupled
                    with my IT skills and passion for tech, the move seemed a natural one.
                    Being a small company, the role was a hybrid between both hardware and software.
                    With no clearly defined job description, I had the freedom to be part of all
                    aspects of the company. I also gained a wealth of experience from this,
                    and was involved in everything from PC Hardware support, to Product Manager
                    of the various web-apps that are in development.</p>

                    The highlights of my employment are as Technical Lead on
                    a high-profile Government Project related to the Immovable Asset
                    Register; and managing the development of a web and mobile app from conception
                    through to launch.

                <h4>Analyst</h4>
                <p>
                    I started at Venn as a Trainee Analyst, after completing three months
                    of intensive on-the-job training, I was promoted to Analyst. From there I was
                    responsible for the analysis and reporting of individual client files.
                    I was also part of the research team that would research and review the latest
                    updates to the National Acts, By-laws and tarrif policies in an effort to better
                    understand them and how they should be implemented. I performed the linking role
                    between the Analyst team and the IT team, and was instrumental in the design
                    and development of the SMART system (Spatially Managed Asset Register Tracker).
                    I also helped pioneer a new product offering, and was part of the team that
                    implemented this into the market.

                    I was intriuiged by sail making, and wanted to learn the nuances of this.
                    However, early on there was a need for an IT Project Manager to implement
                    North Sails Cape Town's transition onto the new North Sails Global Common Software
                    Platform. I took on this role assited with the set-up and subsequent staff training for the platform.

                I've always wanted to be able to code, and build my own software to
                solve problems I've encounterd. With this in mind, I enrolled at General Assembly's

                I attended the University of South Africa via correspondants with the intention

                          As part of GA's WDI program, our first project was to design and build a front end project; we were given TicTacToe.
                          The project was built on using JavaScript, HTML and CSS. I chose bootstrap to help with the styling.
                          The front end communicates with a provided API to save game data on a per user basis.
